<h1>Who are ya?</h1>

Hi! (Awkward hand wave with a possible thumbs-up) My name is Amy Horton and I'm currently a freshman in radiography at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. I am a self-proclaimed geek (of some sort), a theatre techie and an avid reader and television watcher.

With this new experience known as college approaching, I've decided to start writing down and documenting what's going on in my day to day life so that everyone can be up to date on my adventures.

You're probably wondering what the title's about, but I'm going to let that be a mystery for you to ponder as you read and as the posts accumulate.
