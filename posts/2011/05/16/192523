It seems like only yesterday that I was packing up my room after finishing my first year of college at MCPHS. Oh wait. It was just about two weeks ago. All joking aside, they were two wonderful weeks filled with sewing, shopping, painting, Doctor Who, Donald Glover, an epic Saturday, a brilliant CTC show, and really great people. I made the most I could out of that short vacation and although I was extremely sad to see it go, I'm happy with all of the fun stuff I got to do. I am still a bit bitter, though, that I missed the opening of Shelburne Museum by one day. Also, it was quite nice to have finished off a really insanely busy semester and a relatively terrible year with good grades.

So, now it's May 16th, I'm back in Boston and I think things should turn out better than last year. I'll be here for three months (or less, depending on whether or not my school can organize its information and make sense of things). I'm taking a whole bunch of classes: Clinical Pathophysiology, Health Care Ethics, Medical Terminology, X-Ray Radiation Physics, and Foundations of Radiography. Even though it's just the first day of classes, I can already tell that things are going to be quite different. For example:

<ul>
<li>2.5 hour long classes (for Pathophys, Physics, and Foundations)</li>
<li>Online classes (Ethics and most of MedTerm)</li>
<li>Exponentially better roommates (four in total)</li>
<li>Sharing a room with an acual roommate, for that matter</li>
<li>A nearly empty school</li>
<li>Classes only on Monday and Thursday and for an hour on Wednesday</li>
<li>Having to cook because the dining halls are closed and/or have really strange hours (on that note, the two roommates not in my room cooked dinner tonight!) </li>
<li>Sitting in the common room</li>
</UL>
Things are already looking up, and I'm sure that will be a great relief to a few people. It's still really hard to be here in class when everyone else is/will be at home. So I'm using Doctor Who Saturdays, Tim's graduation (!!!), the aquarium, <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i>, my kindle, and the hopes of trips home/visitors to keep me content.

Also, if you have a suggestion for any good recipes, I would greatly appreciate it!
