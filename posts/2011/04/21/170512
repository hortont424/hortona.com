Today I got to see Casey and take her on a really really short tour of MCPHS.

Today I had my last class of Computer Applications. Thank God.

Today I presented a project that has been freaking me out for the past two weeks. It seemed to go okay.

Today I handed in a paper I’ve been working on since Spring Break.

Today I got a package from Mom with delicious Easter candy.

Today I found a wonderful new background that is both adorable and happy. 

Today I listened to people have an angerfest and realized how glad I am that I don’t have to deal with that craziness.

Today I listened to lots and lots of good music to celebrate being done with everything except exams.

Today I realized that in exactly one week I will be packed up and heading home.
