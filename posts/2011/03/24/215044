It's become apparent to me that March and April are insane months. First off, there's the really odd weather. It can be 60 degrees and sunny for a couple of days and then it can SNOW! I'm really quite sick of snow and I wish we could all just agree that it's spring. Anyway. March and April are also pretty crazy due to the sheer volume of work. I'm not opposed to this, as it's been relatively easy so far, and I've been waiting for the challenge. My issue is the absolute stupidity of most of the work. For example, Computer Applications. It's a tedious enough class when we have to learn things that we all mastered in elementary school, but when the professor forbids the use of any cohesive design, it's absolutely useless. Her one requirement is that we use different backgrounds for each slide. Each slide. Basically, we're learning exactly how NOT to make a presentation that any professional person would take seriously.

So. There's that. And then there's Expository Writing. I like reading. I really really like reading. And I really liked this class until a few weeks ago. I mean, the professor is really great and we do some pretty interesting stuff with fairy tales. But a few weeks ago, we got assigned three papers/presentations: one I already referenced about a lasting modern tale, one about a hero from a movie/book and why they're a hero in the society when they were created based on the values/skills they have, and one where we creatively retell a fairy tale in a modern light and explain why we changed what we changed. I'm still in the process of getting my group to agree upon a topic for the first one, but that's not really due for a while. As for the second one, I have a week to write that paper. Well, I've actually had a month... but I spent most of that time procrastinating by doing a first draft of the third paper. (I really need to get my priorities in order.) Anyway, for the past few days, I've had my very own Firefly/Serenity marathon since I chose Malcolm Reynolds as my hero. It wasn't a difficult decision, as my Firefly obsession is quite clear from the posters, pictures, books, DVDs, and Jayne hat in my tiny room. That said, I was under the impression that it would be an easy paper to write. Mal is obviously a hero. He's the hilarious Captain who loves his crew and would do anything for them. He's happy to do a job, get money, and keep flying. The question, however, is why those qualities represent what Americans in 2002 think of as a hero. Oh boy. Well. I think I've gotten somewhere in figuring it out, as you can see from my lovely, color-coordinated, and highlighted notes. Seriously, though. The hardest part has actually been stoping myself from overanalyzing everything that happens because I still want to be able to escape onto Serenity whenever I want.

I should probably get back to work, but I had to take a break from studying/writing/reading to vent my frustration at how ridiculously busy I am in classes that will never matter. With that done, I thought I'd just tell you about something amazing that happened last week. On Wednesday, I went to the Boston Opera House (where I went to see Wicked) and had the pleasure of watching Mary Poppins! It was phenomenal. I don't remember the movie from when I was little, but last year, a bunch of my friends were in a dance recital that was Mary Poppins themed, so I re-watched the movie to figure out what was going on. (They were wonderful, by the way!) So, when I saw that the show was going to be in Boston, I got a ticket (much better than my Wicked ticket through the school). I don't even know what to say about it, besides the fact that it makes me want to quit whatever it is I'm doing here and go and study technical theater somewhere. I was in shock for the entire show and most of the rest of the night trying to figure out how they did any of the effects in the show. Mary Poppins flies. It seems simple enough and happens all of the time, but it's still cool. But wait. At the end, she flies over the audience into the balcony and then ends up on stage a minute later. She flies over the audience. Seriously amazing. Also, there's a scene where the entire set gets destroyed by the children--there are plates everywhere, tables broken, and shelves falling down. Then Mary Poppins comes in, sings, and everything slowly replaces itself. It's hard enough to imagine making all of those things fall in the correct order, at the correct time, but making them go back?!?! I have no idea how that's even possible. There's so much more that I can't even begin to describe. And that's just the tech stuff!! There were gorgeous costumes and props. And I don't even know what to say about the actors themselves. They were phenomenal, epic, amazing, perfect... I think you see where I'm going...

That's been what's going on here in Boston. I cannot wait for this semester to be over. I'm looking forward to going home for a few weeks, seeing Donald Glover in NYC, watching CTC's Glass Menagerie, and having a calm vacation before going back to school (I only have classes two days a week, though, so that's nice).
