I know it's been such an insane amount of time that no one probably reads this anymore, but I still have to try. So, for the one person who gets emails when I post things (coughTimcough), I have a question for you.

<b>If you had to pick one modern movie/book/TV show/etc that you think will outlast our current era and stand the test of time, what would it be?</b> (Note: previous examples have included Harry Potter, Star Wars, Zombie apocalypse-type, sports themed (as in Remember the Titans)...)

You have probably guessed by now that this is part of one of my crazy English assignments. I'm having quite a difficult time thinking of an answer because I still can't seem to figure out how some of the "classics" made it there, which makes me think that whatever I assume is worthy will, in fact, not be. Ideas and suggestions would be greatly welcomed!!!
