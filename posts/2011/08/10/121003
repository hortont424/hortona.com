Every time we came home from New York, we had what was called a "trip night." These nights, after hours of driving, meant that you were responsible for your own dinner, or you were okay with whatever left overs were in the fridge. It's been a while since we've had a legitimate trip night, but after our lovely trip to New York over the weekend, Mom and I arrived home right around dinner time. Dad passed us on the road on the way to his meeting, so it was just the two of us. In preparation for living on my own in a few weeks, I've been cooking some things for dinner to make sure that I won't starve or be entirely dependent on cereal.

For dinner, I made chicken according to a really simple recipe. It's actually just a bunch of herbs on the chicken, cooked on the stove with an onion. Seriously, it was the easiest thing ever. Along with that, I made some cheddar biscuits that were supposed to be extremely similar to those that are served at Red Lobster. We also made a vegetable to go along with it. Since I was busy with the other things, and as I'm not good at balancing cooking lots of things, Mom helped me and made some green beans.

Overall, it was quite good for a trip night! I was really surprised by just how good the chicken was with hardly any effort. And I'm pretty sure we have biscuits for, like, the next month since I already made a ton, and there's still dough in the fridge. Anyway, here's a picture of dinner:

I've also been hanging onto a recipe for butterbeer cupcakes for a while. Butterbeer is a hot or cold butterscotch-y drink from Harry Potter. It's really popular in the books, and when they opened the Wizarding World in Florida, they made a recipe and started selling the drink there. A person on the internet then created a cupcake recipe that looked amazing. So I finally got the inspiration to make it, only to find out that butter flavoring (an integral ingredient) is nearly impossible to find in the state of Vermont. After looking in three or four places, I finally found some last night and then set off to make cupcakes at about 10 PM. Making the actual cupcake part was really easy, just like making any cupcakes. The special thing about these cupcakes, however, was that they have butterscotch ganache in the middle. Or, they're supposed to have butterscotch ganache in the middle. That part was far harder than expected. The recipe said to use a ketchup squeeze bottle with a point, like the ones they have at restaurants. Since we didin't have one, I was planning to use an icing bag and tip. The squeeziness of the ketchup bottle, however, it quite vital to the success of this adventure, however. The ganache just flowed through the bag and ended up all over the floor/counter/my socks/pants/hands/every available surface. Once I finally figured out that putting my finger over the hole stopped the waterfall, I started filling the cupcakes. To this moment, I'm not sure if there's actually any butterscotch ganache in the cupcakes. I have no idea if anything went in, or if it just kind of seeped out of the top. We'll see. The icing for the cupcakes was buttercream, which dad and I had to trek out at 10:30 in the pouring rain to get more butter for. While making the frosting and ganache, I'm pretty sure I ate at least a cup or two of sugar purely because it was so delicious. So I iced the cupcakes, decorated them with some more ganache and ended up with this:

Today, I made some wonderful waffles with Michaela, and I'm hoping to make spinach and pesto lasagna in the crock pot for dinner. I'll let you know how that turns out!
