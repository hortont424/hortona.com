Below is the current schedule for my second semester classes. Overall, it seems pretty good, espeically Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And I suppose it's nice to get the labs over early in the week, though early in the morning is kind of annoying. My only real issue is that I have to take computer applications. I mean, really. Also more expository writing...
