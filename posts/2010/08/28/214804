On Thursday, I received an amazing thing. A new iPhone 4! Two very amazing people, the best aunts in the world, gave me the phone, for my birthday/Graduation/Christmas/whatever. After installing all of my apps and syncing all of my music, I gave the phone (Hera) a test drive in the most difficult situation possible. New York City. Tim, Nate, Carol and I ventured to the "center of the universe" for a whirlwind 18 hour trip that included shopping at H&M, sitting on big rocks in Central Park, exploring the Metropolitan Museum of Art, eating in Little Italy, walking across a very long bridge and avoiding scary people in Penn Station. Through all of those wonderful adventures, my phone happily kept me updated on everything going on, gave us some navigation assistance and even helped me record the trip.

I can't wait to see what Hera has to offer in Boston. I'm sure it will be an irreplaceable tool to help from getting lost on the adventures that I take into Boston. The idea of those adventures, however, is banking on me being able to leave my dorm room and the library, which may be difficult with my schedule for the fall.
