Hi everybody!

I currently have less than two weeks before I venture off to that crazy place known as college. As almost all of you know, I'll be attending the <a href="http://www.mcphs.edu/">Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences</a> with a major in radiography.

While I'm at college, I want to keep everyone updated on the awesome adventures and confusing classes that happen every day, so I'll be writing random things here pretty often. Keep checking back to find out what I'm up to in Boston!
