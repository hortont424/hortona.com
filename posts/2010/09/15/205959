After class and a bit of homework on Tuesday I took the T to Boylston Street to go see Wicked at the Boston Opera House. I got a ticket about a week ago from  Student Activities here at school. Wicked is, without a doubt, one of my favorite musicals because of the story, music and amazing scenery and costumes. I saw Wicked on Broadway with Mom, Dad and Tim two years ago (on my 16th birthday) and I remember it being amazing. But simply "amazing" doesn't cut it. I actually don't have words for the brilliance that is Wicked. It's impossible to describe, you just have to see it (*cough*).

Anyway, I arrived at the theater and I was promptly awestruck. The Boston Opera House is gorgeous. It's insanely ornate and a little bit over the top (see above). I climbed a ton of stairs and finally found my seat, Balcony Center U114. The last row of the balcony. I was extremely nervous for the half hour that I sat waiting because I could barely see anything that was on the stage. I did, however, have an amazing view of the ceiling (see below) and the dragon (see below below) that represents the clock in the show (it moves!). Once the show started, however, people settled in and I found a wonderful position that let me see everything (thank goodness I had an aisle seat!)

The show itself was every positive adjective you can find. The Fiyero was better than the one on Broadway, the Glinda was hilarious, and the Elphaba (the understudy) liked to add her own spin to everything. I was a little bit disappointed by Defying Gravity, but they made up for it by having a wonderful Dancing Through Life and For Good. The thing I find really distracting about the show is the technical half. I sat there, immersed in the show, but wondering how they make their amazing sets look and move the way they do, how they have Boq turn into the Tin Man ON STAGE and how the Defying Gravity flying bit works. I don't even know where to begin. The tech people that work on that show are brilliant because everything seems to work perfectly and you never even notice when random gear-shaped set pieces move in. It's incredible. Now, don't even get me started on the costumes. From what I could see from my seat, they are intense. There's really no other word.


In short, everything about the show was perfect. I loved it, and I'm really glad I went, even though I didn't have anyone to go with and some guy kept yelling at this kid to get off his phone...

Today, however was a whole different story. After getting home last night at 11:30 and then not being able to go to sleep for a long while, it was quite difficult to get up at 7:30 for my 9:00 First Year Seminar class. Why I needed to get up that early, you ask? Because the elevators are still scary and take forever and I cannot walk into the basement (where my class is) without getting automatically lost. The day, however, was made much better when I received an adorable card from mom that included some delicious Bounty Bars. They made everything automatically better. As did my awesome exponent skills in algebra and my dimensional analysis skills in chemistry. Now, I just have a ton of reading to do.
