So today is the second day that I've officially been moved into college. It's an insane experience that is nearly impossible to describe. It's amazing because I'm really excited to learn everything that I possibly can, but it's horrifying because I'm quite alone here so far.

Yesterday was a very hectic and rushed day. We left Vermont at around noon and headed to Boston. The car was pretty full and I'm regretting not taking a picture of all of the stuff from my previous post jammed into the back of the van. After a few rough hours in the car, we finally arrived and were welcomed by some orange-shirted RAs and Orientation Leaders who carted all of my stuff up to my room in two orange carts. At the same time, I went to get my ID and keys and by the time I was done, all of my stuff was upstairs and all throughout my room. 

After quite some time and a lot of effort, I organized the majority of my stuff and my room, which started as a blank-almost-jail-cell, became an acceptable living space.

So my room is smaller than I expected, but it's comfortable. On the left is my bed, which is quite high, but allows for a lot of space below for storage and fort-making. In the center is command central—my desktop, books, DVDs, school supplies, textbooks, and memories from home. On the right is half of my dresser/closet.

To the right of my computer, and on my dresser is my friend wall. There're pictures from Andros, sound crew, Shelburne Museum, Graduation and Honors Banquet, Godspell and my birthday. Also, you can see some wonderful posters—Kaylee (thanks Tim!) and the height poster from XKCD. I have plenty more to hang up, but I seem to be lacking in magnets or tape of some sort. That'll be a project for another day! In addition, the plastic wrap is holding my lab goggles and the green box below it is my molecule model kit.

My bed. Pretty self explanatory...

Our kitchen, which is pretty small, but should do. Our stove seems to be electric, which is nice because it's what I'm used to, but there will still definitely be some adventures in the cooking department. We're still trying to figure out where the microwave, toaster oven, utensils and everything else will fit... there's definitely not enough space!

This is our bathroom. It's quite nice for a freshman dorm, especially since it's only for two people.

So that's pretty much the basic tour of my living quarters right now. I'm sure there will be more pictures (of the living room area and hall lounge, for example) in the future, but this is basically everything that's important right now.

Last night I went to see the Blue Man Group with the majority of the freshman class. It was an adventure since it involved getting almost two hundred people on the T, which made the people who weren't involved a bit angry. Once we got there, though, it was amazing. The show itself is awesome! It's hilarious and interactive and really pretty (with all of the paint and lights and glow-in-the-dark stuff). They also have some pretty amazing and intense tech people!

After the show, I went back to my dorm and went almost directly to sleep. In an amazing feat of epicness, I woke up four minutes before my alarm at 8:00. Everyone else was taking their Chemistry Diagnostic Test (which I don't have to take because I'm in a lower chemistry class...), so I ate some cereal and hung out in the hall lounge. Then I met mom and dad and we went grocery shopping (for bread, cereal and juice) to have some edible food in the kitchen. I then had my first nutella milkshake as an official student (!) and then sent mom and dad back off to Vermont. I'm not going to lie, it was a very sad thing, but I came back to my room and listened to other people talking and helped them set up their internet, so all was well... eventually.

Today we had our first semi-official class. The freshmen class is divided up by major into First Year Seminar Classes to help us with the transition into college life. We had our first meeting today to get introduced and to discuss the book that we read over the summer (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks). As it turns out, only two or three other people even finished the book, which brought up a whole new issue... I'm still a little bit confused as to why a few of these people are here since they don't seem to have any affinity for studying, reading, or learning in any way. It's pretty odd because I was under the assumption that people would care a bit, but apparently it's still pretty similar to high school... oh joy.

I'm also still in the process of making some friends, which is much more difficult than I remember. I'm under the impression that it should be like kindergarten because no one has friends and whatnot, but it's far more difficult. I'm still in search of the geeky/nerdy sector of this school... I hope there is one...

Anyway, after that, I sat in my room, talking to people from home and continuing to set up. Finally, I decided to go find some dinner. Even though I only have half a meal plan, I figured that if I ate dinner at the dining commons tonight it would be alright. I had some pretty good pasta with tomatoes and broccoli (vegetables!). And now I'm back, sitting in my dorm, watching as the public safety officer tries to open Cassandra's door (not a single key—the RA or building manager—worked). We seem to have success!

Anyway, I'm going to look through my text books right now to see what I'm going to be up against in the next few months... :)
