Note To Self:
Open windows can cause weird air currents that cause doors to slam shut. 

This is most likely to happen when:
<UL>
<LI>your door is locked 
<LI>you do not have shoes or socks on 
<LI>you do not have your keys in your pocket
<LI>you are just going to put your dishes in the sink
</UL>
Solution: Have your keys in your pocket even when you are sitting at your desk studying for a psychology exam.

Anyway, I'm back in my room now and I must get back to my studying/reading/editing! Happy 10/10/10!
