I just wanted to give you all an update on what's been going on this week. I'm currently hiding in my room, sitting under a pile of homework that I should have gotten to over the weekend.

I'm actively working on a critical essay on Orwell's "Shooting an Elephant" on my laptop (and the two random books in the middle). I'm taking a break from taking notes on my Anatomy & Physiology chapter focusing on tissues (the large book and notebook on the left). And I'm going to finish up my pre-lab for Chemistry on atomic mass (the purple and blue papers on the right) at some point. Thankfully, I'm getting some help from a really wonderful tiny friend! (Also, Bounty Bars are great.)

Also this week:
<ul>
<li>Test grades back for A&P (94%) and Chemistry (104%)</li>
<li>Continued pain from algebra word problems</li>
<li>Success in First Year Seminar Jeopardy = Starbuck's Gift Card</li>
</ul>
Anyway, I'm expecting a pretty boring weekend full of reading and other various pieces of homework followed by a week of tests/midterms, so I probably won't have anything more interesting to write about until October 15th (AKA The-Best-Day-Ever!). See you then!
