It's been quite a week since Mom and Dad visited! I had an two tests and a quiz, all of which were easier than I expected. I have yet to get grades back for either of my Anatomy & Physiology assessments, but they should be coming soon. As for my chemistry exam, my professor posted the correct answers, and, if I marked everything down right on my score sheet, I should get a 100% plus the bonus points from the extra credit question! That makes me quite happy! Hopefully my A&P grades are somewhere around there too...

After that fun filled week, some sort of epic weekend was definitely in order. On Friday night, I basically sat around, reading and watching TV. It was quite nice since I'd been studying every single night all week. Then, on Saturday, I woke up early and headed to Northeastern to pick Meredith up so we could go visit the most amazing place in the world--the Boston Museum of Science! Seriously, though, the Museum of Science is definitely one of my favorite things in Boston! We spent five hours exploring the awesomeness that's housed inside. We got to see a live kestrel, the intense lightning show, a triceratops skeleton, crazy optical illusions, a bell curve in action, a singing staircase, and lots and lots of other things that are too awesome to divulge.

After chatting and having lunch, searching through the gift shop for cool things (like nerdy pins), and eating ice cream/dippin' dots, we went outside to wait for our Duck Tour! Duck Tours are awesome. They're probably tied with the Museum of Science for cool things to do in Boston. Anyway, our conDUCKtor was PJ Keen, an awesome "narcoleptic" woman in her pajamas who really loves random trivia about Boston (including many hilarious firsts) and theater! She was pretty hilarious. She took us around Boston on the peach colored "Commonwealth Curley" (see below) and we got to see tons of sights, including: Faneuil Hall, the Old State House, Boston Common, King's Chapel Burying Ground, Granary Burying Ground, Boston Public Library, Trinity Church, the Zakim Bridge and many, many other places! After driving around the city, we splashed into the Charles River and went under the Longfellow Bridge and floated around for a while (see above). We actually got to see  duck boat get towed by another duck boat. It was a little bit sad, especially since the people being towed had to wear their life vests...

Once I was back to my dorm, I had to do some homework in order to bring the level of awesomeness down a bit so that it didn't break the scale! That homework involved some evil word problems, an essay by the exceedingly confusing George Orwell and a reading about different types of tissue. Whoo.

Also, I got to skype with some awesome people in New York! I wish I had been here earlier so that I could talk to other people, but that'll have to happen at some other point!

All in all, it was a wonderful day!!! And since it was so awesome, I'm taking next weekend to recover because the weekend after that is going to be just as epic (maybe more, if that's possible!), with a Belle and Sebastian concert and three days of Comic-Con/Buffy Fest. And to top that all off, it involves Tim Horton being here!!!
