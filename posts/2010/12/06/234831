I can’t believe I’m saying this, but my first semester in college is already coming to a close. I know it’s been quite a while since I’ve said anything, but that’s mostly due to the sheer amount of information that I’ve been forcing my brain to devour. As finals are approaching, and all of my final projects, presentations and essays are being turned in, it’s hard for me to comprehend that three months have gone by. It feels like just yesterday I was moving in and trying to figure out how to navigate the school. And though a lot has changed (in every way), I somehow made it. I owe a ton to you, my amazing family and friends, who helped me through every single thing—from being homesick and lonely to not knowing what to write a speech about and from trying to memorize muscles to dealing with... people. I can’t wait to get out of here for a little while and see everyone again and have some help locating nourishment, but I felt that I needed to thank you all first. Gracias! See you soon! (And if you’re in school, good luck on exams!!)
