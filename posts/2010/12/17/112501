Well. This is odd. And really exciting! I can now officially say that I've completed my first semester of college. I just finished my last final (Anatomy & Physiology), so I'm free to escape this crazy place for three weeks! That is a really, really good feeling!

Overall, this week went far better than I expected. The tests were easier and I got much more sleep than the cramming people. Also, it involved a wonderful day with Tim and Mom. They came down a day early so they wouldn't have to drive for hours and hours on end, and we went to the Museum of Science IMAX, an awesome restaurant, and Mike's Pastry. It was a wonderfully relaxing day before my last exam.

Now that this is all over (for now), I cannot wait to go home, see everyone, sleep in my own bed, eat food that's not from the cafeteria, drive, not deal with crazy people.... It's going to be the best Christmas break ever. No question.
